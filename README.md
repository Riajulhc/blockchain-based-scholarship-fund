# Scholarship Fund Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Scholarship Fund Smart Contract** provides a secure and transparent system for collecting contributions and distributing scholarships. By leveraging Ethereum's blockchain, this project ensures that funds are managed and allocated fairly. Our vision is to create a decentralized platform that enhances trust and efficiency in the management of scholarship funds.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart outlines the workflow of the Scholarship Fund:

1. **Contract Deployment**
   - Initialize the contract with a specified scholarship amount.

2. **Contributor Donations**
   - Contributors send funds to the scholarship fund.

3. **Fund Accumulation**
   - Track the total funds and individual contributions.

4. **Scholarship Distribution**
   - The owner distributes the scholarship to the selected recipient.

5. **Owner Withdrawal**
   - After distribution, the owner can withdraw any remaining funds.
